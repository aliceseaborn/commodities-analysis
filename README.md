# Commodities Analysis

This repository represents a crude analysis of precious metals commodities vis a vis their relative risk level against the market. The data wrangling that occurs therein can be expanded upon to answer more complex questions should the need arise. All data for gold , silver, and the benchmark broad US index (^GSPC) come from Yahoo finance and reach 20 years from the date of publication (APR 27 2021).
